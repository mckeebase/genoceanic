# Genoceanic
Leveraging the power of Open Data Standards in the world of Genomics.

## What is Genoceanic?
Northern Ireland patients are participating in the UK **100,000 Genomes Project**. This involves collating **consent**, **phenotype** and **genomic** data and transmitting this securely to *Genomics England Ltd*.

Genoceanic consists of two primary components:

1. A clinical data repository based on OpenEHR
1. A front end for data entry and review, called **GENIE**

## What is GENIE?

## What is OpenEHR?

## How does Genoceanic relate to Encompass?
Genoceanic is a separate project from Encompass, but is designed to use open data standards (OpenEHR), so that it can ultimately be integrated with Encompass and/or the vendor-neutral open platform that works along with the Encompass architecture. The philosophy is "Once for Northern Ireland" - Genoceanic will be built to work alongside regional developments, and not in its own little silo. Although the initial phase will be developed within Belfast Trust, our plan is to liaise with regional stakeholders and the Encompass team at the earliest available opportunity after the award of contract to establish the relevant data linkages. We are satisfied that the requirements of Genoceanic are sufficiently generic that they will have no influence over the selection process for Encompass.
