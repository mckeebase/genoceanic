# Genoceanic
Leveraging the power of Open Data Standards in the world of Genomics.

## What is Genoceanic?
Northern Ireland patients are participating in the UK [**100,000 Genomes Project**](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/). This involves collating **consent**, **phenotype** and **genomic** data and transmitting this securely to [*Genomics England Ltd*](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/).

We aim to recruit up to 1000 patients and relatives with a variety of rare diseases and cancers to the Northern Ireland contribution to the 100KGP. 

Genoceanic consists of two primary components:

1. A front end for data entry and review, called **GENIE**
1. A clinical data repository based on **OpenEHR**

## What is GENIE?
GENIE is a software platform created by [University Hospitals Birmingham to support the West Midlands Genomic Medicine Centre](https://www.uhb.nhs.uk/west-midlands-genomic-medicine-centre.htm)'s activity within the 100,000 Genomes Project. 
set up data formats to match GEL dataset
synchronise data
allow recruitment and data management
align with ordering system for the new Genetic test directory

## What is OpenEHR?
[OpenEHR](http://www.openehr.org) is the de facto international standard information modelling system for healthcare data.
Allow linkages with Trust (and eventually HSCNI) systems
ENsure data model is portable betweem care settings
Allow rich data acquisition to inform analysis of genomic data

## Why "Genoceanic"?
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Belfast was the ship-building capital of the world, with its Harland & Wolff shipyard designing and constructing some of the most iconic liners of the period, including the ill-fated Titanic. **Oceanic** was one of H&W's earlier liners, and at the time of her construction, she was the largest and most versatile ship ever built. 
"Genoceanic" stands for **Gen**omic **O**pen **C**ore **E**ngine for **A**ccelerating **NI** **C**are. Using this architecture, we can ensure that our developments in genomics will align with regional and national objectives to ensure that the clinical data which our patients have entrusted to us will continue to provide benefit when Encompass comes along.

## How does Genoceanic relate to Encompass?
Genoceanic is a separate project from Encompass, but is designed to use open data standards (OpenEHR), so that it can ultimately be integrated with Encompass and/or the vendor-neutral open platform that works along with the Encompass architecture. The philosophy is "Once for Northern Ireland" - Genoceanic will be built to work alongside regional developments, and not in its own little silo. Although the initial phase will be developed within Belfast Trust, our plan is to liaise with regional stakeholders and the Encompass team at the earliest available opportunity after the award of contract to establish the relevant data linkages. We are satisfied that the requirements of Genoceanic are sufficiently generic that they will have no influence over the selection process for Encompass.
