## What is Genoceanic?
Northern Ireland patients are participating in the UK **100,000 Genomes Project**. This involves collating **consent**, **phenotype** and **genomic** data and transmitting this securely to *Genomics England Ltd*.

Genoceanic consists of two primary components:

1. A clinical data repository based on OpenEHR
1. A front end for data entry and review, called **GENIE**
